# Proposals

This repo contains any Extism Improvement Proposal, and should follow the format of:

```
EIP-NNN-name-of-proposal.md
```

## Submitting a Proposal

Anyone can submit a proposal, and this is the recommended way to begin any work you'd like to 
contribute, or to suggest a change or feature.

Steps: 

1. Open an issue with a high-level idea of what the improvement or change would include and why.
2. Extism members will engage with you about the proposal and will create the EIP, for further 
collaboration.
3. The new EIP will act as a living document for specification.
